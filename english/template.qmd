Dear Prof. Dr. Doe,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the postdoctoral research position advertised by your department. I believe my research experience and expertise make me an excellent candidate for this role.

Currently, I work as a research associate at the Institute for Sample Studies at Freie Universität Berlin. My research focuses on **experimental methods** and *theoretical modeling* in the field of example sciences.

Over the past few years, I have:

- Successfully conducted multiple research projects

I would be delighted to contribute my expertise to your team and work together on innovative research questions.

I am available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to discussing this opportunity with you.

Sincerely,
